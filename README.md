# LEO: Your Personal Local Voice Assistant
###### A Project made using Machine Learning<br>

## Algorithm Used: Decision Tree
- A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression.<br>
- It is a type of model that uses a tree-like structure, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.<br>
- The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

## STEPS TO IMPLEMENT
#### ❑ Data Pre-processing  
▪ Create Dataset  
▪ Arrange Data into features and target <br><br>
#### ❑ Implementation of Algorithm
▪ Import necessary packages (like: speech_recognition, pyttsx3, sklearn.tree, DecisionTree Classifier, pandas, webbrowser andurllib.parse)  
▪ Storing all the inputs value in a variable and response value in another variable  
▪ Train the decision tree model  
▪ Implement voice recognition system  
#### ❑ Define a flag to indicate whether the voice assistant should be active or not  
▪ If flag is true then voice assistant is active  
▪ Use the decision tree model to predict response  
▪ Implement text-to-speech system to output response  
▪ Print the input and response as text  
▪ If flag is false then stop the voice assistant.<br><br>

#### CONCLUSION
╸ In my project i utilized decision tree algorithms, which gives higher accuracy than other machine learning algorithms.  
╸ The use of decision tree algorithms in local voice assistants has shown great potential in recognizing speech commands and responding accordingly.  
╸ These systems can be particularly useful in situations where internet connectivity is limited, where it is challenging to use cloud-based voice assistants.
